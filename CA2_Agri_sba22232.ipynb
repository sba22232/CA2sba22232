    "The datasets I am going to use are from The food and agricultural Organisation (FAO). The food and agricultural  trade dataset is collected, processed and disseminated by FAO according to the standard International Merchandise Trade Statistics (IMTS) Methodology. The data is mainly provided by UNSD, Eurostat, and other national authorities as needed. This source data is checked for outliers, trade partner data is used for non-reporting countries or missing cells, and data on food aid is added to take into account total cross-border trade flows. The trade database includes the following variables: export quantity, export value, import quantity, and import value. The trade database includes all food and agricultural products imported/exported annually by all the countries in the world.\n",
